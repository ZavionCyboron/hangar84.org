                Why sponsor us? The reason why we would like you to sponsor us is to allow us to be able to go on trips for FRC competitions,
                buy better parts and pieces for our robot to allow us to have a better chance in winning a competition.
                If you sponsor us we will put your company, organization, etc. logo on the back of our shirt.
                We will also give you bracelets, shirts, buttons, logo, and stickers. If you are wanting to
