            We are a student-led FRC robotics team at Early College High School in Roswell, New Mexico.
            The year we started as a FRC robotics team was 2018 and have been to every competition besides 2021 and 2022 competitions.
            At Hangar 84, we are open to any suggestions on how to improve not only our robot designs but also our source code and website.
            We also accept anyone that wants to join our team. If you want to join our team give us an email at (insert email here).
